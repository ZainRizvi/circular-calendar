# Intuitive Circle Calendar

An annual calendar that's easy for little kids (and adults) to understand.

## Instructions

1. Print out the pdf
2. Cut out all the months
3. Stick the months of the solar calendar on the wall in a circle (sticky putty works great here). If it's not a leap year, then cover up the 29th of Feb with May 1st.
4. Place the Islamic months on the inner ring, aligning each day with it's corresponding day on the solar calendar. Use an Islamic calendar or moonsighting.com to figure out if the month should have 29 or 30 days. If it should have 29 days, cover up the 30th day with the 1st of the next month.
5. You'll end up with a small gap in the Islamic calendar's circle, since the Islamic year has fewer days. As each Islamic month ends, you can shift it counter clockwise to cover up the gap.

## Optional

- Laminate the pages before cutting out the months to make the calendar more durable
- Cut out an arrow to point to the current day
- Cut out arrow shaped tags to mark key events like important Islamic days, birthdays, etc
