# Vinyl Sticker Printing Research for Circular Calendar

## Current Setup
- 24 curved arc strips (12 solar + 12 Islamic months) printed across 3 letter-sized pages
- Each arc is a pre-curved annular segment (~0.8" radial thickness)
- Assembled into a ~2–3 ft diameter circle on the wall
- Printed on regular paper via inkjet printers

## Goal
Find services that can print the arcs as **pre-cut vinyl wall stickers**, eliminating manual cutting and improving durability.

## Option 2: DIY with Cricut/Silhouette (Print Then Cut)

If you want to produce multiple copies or iterate quickly, a home cutting machine can print on vinyl sticker paper and then cut the arc shapes automatically.

### How It Works
1. Print arcs on **printable vinyl sticker paper** using a regular inkjet printer
2. Feed the printed sheet into a Cricut/Silhouette machine
3. The machine reads registration marks and cuts each arc to shape

### Machines
- **Cricut Explore Air 3 / Maker** – Best for Print Then Cut
- **Silhouette Cameo 4** – More reliable print-then-cut alignment

### Limitations
- **Max print-then-cut size: 6.75" × 9.25"** (Cricut) — your arcs may exceed this
- Would need to split arcs to fit within the cutting area
- Requires buying the machine ($200–$400) + printable vinyl sheets (~$1/sheet)

### Materials
- Printable vinyl sticker paper (waterproof options: Royal Elements, Orajet, Starcraft)
- Transfer tape for application
- Laminate sheets for durability (optional)

## Option 3: Local Sign/Print Shops

Most local sign shops have wide-format printers and vinyl cutters. They can:
- Print your PDF/SVG on adhesive vinyl
- Contour-cut each arc to shape
- Apply transfer tape for easy wall application

**Pros**: You can discuss the project in person, see material samples, fast local turnaround.
**Cons**: Pricing varies widely. Expect $8–$15/sq ft for print + contour cut.

Search for "custom vinyl decal printing" or "sign shop" in your area.

## Estimated Costs (24 arc pieces, ~2–3 ft assembled circle)

Each arc is roughly 5–8" long × 1" wide. Total vinyl area for all 24 arcs is small — roughly 1–2 sq ft total.

| Approach | Est. Cost for 1 Set (24 arcs) | Notes |
|----------|-------------------------------|-------|
| **Budget online service** (Printmoz) | ~$15–$30 | Depends on how you order (individual pieces vs. sheet) |
| **Mid-range online** (StickyLife, Signs.com) | ~$30–$60 | Per-piece pricing, contour cut |
| **Premium online** (Sticker Mule, Printastic) | ~$40–$80 | Higher quality vinyl, better adhesive |
| **Wall Decal World** (single large decal) | ~$25–$50 | Could print entire circle as one decal |
| **Cricut/Silhouette DIY** | ~$5–$10/set (after machine cost) | Ongoing cost is just vinyl sheets |
| **Local sign shop** | ~$30–$75 | Varies by location |

> **Note**: Ordering each of 24 arcs as individual stickers will cost more than ordering a few sheets with multiple arcs per sheet. Most services charge per piece, so batching arcs onto fewer designs is more economical.

## Recommended Approach

### For simplicity (order and done):
1. **Export each page of arcs as a high-res PDF/PNG** (the 3 calendar pages you already generate)
2. **Upload to [StickyLife](https://www.stickylife.com/wall-decals) or [Signs.com](https://www.signs.com/custom-decals/)** as 3 separate wall decals
3. **Select contour/die-cut** so each arc is individually cut on the sheet
4. Apply to wall using included transfer tape

### For best wall decal experience:
- **[Sticker Mule Wall Graphics](https://www.stickermule.com/products/wall-graphics)** — removable, won't damage walls, free proof, fast turnaround

### For whole-circle approach:
- Modify the code to output the **full assembled circle as a single large SVG/PDF**
- Order as one 2–3 ft wall decal from **[Wall Decal World](https://www.walldecalworld.com/product/custom-wall-decals/custom-die-cut-wall-decal)** or **[Printastic](https://www.printastic.com/large-format-decals/)**
- Eliminates assembly entirely

### For recurring/bulk production:
- Invest in a **Cricut Maker** (~$300) + printable vinyl
- Ongoing cost per calendar drops to ~$5–$10 in materials
- Full control over iteration and reprints

## File Format Recommendations

For best results with any vinyl printing service:
- **Vector formats preferred**: SVG, AI, EPS (infinitely scalable, clean cuts)
- Your project already generates SVG as an intermediate format — this is ideal
- Export at the final desired size (2–3 ft diameter)
- For raster uploads: 300 DPI minimum at final print size
- Ensure all text is converted to outlines/paths (your SVG already does this)

## Code Changes Needed

To support vinyl printing, consider:
1. **Add a "full circle" SVG export mode** — outputs the assembled circle as a single file instead of linear strips across multiple pages
2. **Add bleed/margin** for contour cutting (~1/16" to 1/8")
3. **Export individual arc SVGs** — one file per month for per-piece ordering
4. **Scale factor adjustment** — ensure output matches desired 2–3 ft final diameter
